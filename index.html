		Preliminary Steps
	</h2>
	<p>
		You only just need to execute the grailsw run-app command that should boot up the website on port 8080.
		If something doesn't work you might have to import and rebuild the project in you IDE.
		I have not modified anything that should change the start-up process
	</p>

		Description
	</h2>
	<p>
		Upon starting up the website, you are presented with a login page of the website on the port 8080.
		There are two valid accounts (username:admin & password:admin - username:guest password:guest).
		In order to see the experience the full potential of the website you need to be an admin.
		Upon login, you land on the homepage.
		This homepage contains all the major features of this site.
		Basically, you can click on the "Create Post" Button write a blog post, make use of all the formatting options, save your post and then admire what you've written.
		You can even create Hyper-Links if you wish to do so - of course I used some input validation here.
		The posts are saved and retrieved via a database.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's probably less obvious is the fact that the posts are exposed as a service. If you want, you can test it.
		But you need to keep in mind that this might be a bit cumbersome because you first to retrieve an access token.
		If you want to do that, you need to first send a POST request to localhost:8080/api/login and copy the access_token in the response.
		Thereafter, you need to send a GET request to localhost:8080/api/post with one header.
		The key in this header is a X-Auth-Token and the corresponding value is the previously received token.
		Also, you need to keep in mind, that this service is never actually used on the website.
