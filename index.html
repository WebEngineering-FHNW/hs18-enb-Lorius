		Preliminary Steps
	</h2>
	<p>
		You only just need to execute the grailsw run-app command that should boot up the website on port 8080.
		If something doesn't work you might have to import and rebuild the project in you IDE.
		I have not modified anything that should change the start-up process
	</p>
	<h2>
		Description
	</h2>
	<p>
		Upon starting the website up. You are presented with a homepage of the website on the port 8080.
		This homepage contains all the major features of this site.
		Basically, you can click on the "Create Post" Button write a blog post, make use of all the formatting options, save your post and then admire what you've written.
		You can even create Hyper-Links if you wish to do so - of course I used some input validation here.
		The posts are saved and retrieved via a database.
		At an earlier point in time the posts table in the database was also exposed as a service - this, however, ceased working after adding the PostController.
		Now you only get an error when you try to go to /posts.
